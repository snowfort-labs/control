# Project Vision: The Loom - AI Agent Orchestration Platform

## Core Concept

The Loom is a desktop application designed to orchestrate multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) across multiple projects and tasks. It addresses the fundamental challenge of parallel, asynchronous AI-assisted development: **context switching overload**.

### The Loom Metaphor

Like a traditional loom that weaves parallel threads into a single fabric, this platform takes multiple concurrent AI agent tasks and weaves them through a single human focal point. The user becomes a **queue processor** - focusing on one thread at a time to minimize context switching, then allowing work to fan back out into parallel execution.

```
Multiple Projects → Multiple Tasks → Multiple Agents → User Queue → Parallel Execution
```

## Current AI Agent Landscape (June 2025)

### Claude Code
- Anthropic's agentic coding tool with multi-agent capabilities
- Sophisticated "thinking modes" and sub-agent spawning
- Terminal-based with GitHub/GitLab integration
- MCP server/client architecture

### OpenAI Codex CLI
- Open-source, launched April 2025
- Runs locally with sandboxed execution
- Multimodal inputs (text, screenshots, diagrams)
- Approval modes from suggestion-only to full-auto

### Gemini CLI
- Just announced June 2025, open-source and free
- ReAct loop with MCP server integration
- High usage allowance (60 requests/min, 1000/day)
- Versatile beyond just coding

## Future Vision

The Loom represents a paradigm shift in software development orchestration. As AI agents become more capable, the bottleneck shifts from agent capability to human cognitive load. By solving the orchestration problem, we enable developers to leverage AI at unprecedented scale while maintaining quality, stability, and sanity.

This isn't just a task manager - it's a **cognitive load balancer** for the AI-assisted development era.
